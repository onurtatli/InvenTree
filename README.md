# InvenTree
InvenTree is an open-source Inventory Management System which provides powerful low-level stock control and part tracking. The core of the InvenTree system is a Python/Django database backend which provides an admin interface (web-based) and a JSON API for interaction with external interfaces and applications.

InvenTree is designed to be lightweight and easy to use for SME or hobbyist applications, where many existing stock management solutions are bloated and cumbersome to use. Updating stock is a single-action process and does not require a complex system of work orders or stock transactions. 

However, powerful business logic works in the background to ensure that stock tracking history is maintained, and users have ready access to stock level information.

# Companion App

InvenTree is supported by a [companion mobile app](https://inventree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/app/app/) which allows users access to stock control information and functionality. 

[**Download InvenTree from the Android Play Store**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=inventree.inventree_app)

*Currently the mobile app is only availble for Android*
