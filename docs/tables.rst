InvenTree uses `Bootstrap Table <https://bootstrap-table.com/>`_ to manage tabulated data in the web front-end. The ability to tabulate data from read via an AJAX request allows tables to be updated on-the-fly (without a full page reload).

Bootstrap Table also provides integrated tools for table searching, filtering, and advanced rendering.

Frontend code for table functionality can be found at ``InvenTree/static/script/inventree/tables.js``.
